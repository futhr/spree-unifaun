## Overview

Unifaun Online is an online service for printing shipping labels, management of electronic data transfer (EDI) and monitoring of shipping services.

Shipping documents are produced using Unifaun Online follows the carrier's actual specifications.

Depending on the carrier and mode of transport may shipping documents contain various elements, such as barcodes serder-/kolli-id, customer number, service dispatch and recipient information, delivery and route codes. If the route code or delivery point shall be Unifaun Online can automatically look up the best of this information is not provided by the ERP system.

Although mailing lists and customs documents can be printed as needed. Correct shipping documents allows transport buyer will not have any additional charges from the carrier and facilitates all stages of the supply chain. Unifaun responsible for updating the layouts when carriers change in their specifications.

EDI follow the respective transport current specification. Advance EDI normally sent shortly after the printing of shipping document (unless shipping date is set in the future).

The format is often a carrier-specific variant of IFTMIN (Shipping Information).

Sending pre-EDI is often required by carriers to not surcharges are added to the shipping cost.

Unifaun also responsible here to update the format of EDI when carriers change in their specifications.

Monitoring done broadcasting can be done by the carrier sending the EDI back to Unifaun Online detailing the status changes for each consignment eg if the package is on the way or handed to the recipient.Depending on the carrier and service, this can be seen in Unifaun Online's broadcasting history. From history, even a detailed package increase allowed with the carrier providing the service.

Unifaun Online is carrier neutral and works the same way for all the carriers that are supported by the system (taking into account the differences in the various carriers services).

To use Unifaun Online, there must be an agreement with Unifaun and agreements with and account number of the current conveyors.

### Unifaun ERPConnect via Online Connect

ERPConnect via software Unifaun Online Connect is an additional function to Unifaun Online as Unifaun provides for an additional fee. This enables a direct connection between a company's business and Unifaun Online. Users can enter orders in the ERP system and get shipping labels printed and EDI sent without using Unifaun Online's user interface.

To use Unifaun ERPConnect to Unifaun Online requires, in addition to an agreement with Unifaun associated with a user identity in Unifaun Online, the ERP system can create approved order files as well as a Java-based application from Unifaun installed and used to mail order files to Unifaun Online. For printing frakthandlingar needed an installed Java-based application from Unifaun.

More information is available on [www.unifaun.com](www.unifaun.com).

For users of Web-based business applications, however the software to Unifaun ERPConnect be difficult to utilize in practice.

### Unifaun ERPConnect via XMLPosting

ERPConnect via XMLPosting called a service Unifaun introduces an opportunity for users of Web-based ERP order to post files directly to Unifaun Online. It is not intended to be used directly by the end user without the ERP vendor for technical integration with Unifaun Online, so that their customers in turn, benefit Unifaun ERPConnect.

The prerequisite for using the method XMLPosting is that the ERP system is operated, developed and adapted by the ERP vendor on behalf of the end user / customer. In this case the order files created and posted by the ERP system so that customers do not have to install and use Unifaun client software to mail order files. Otherwise the same conditions as for the software. For printing shipping document still requires the Windows-based client software from Unifaun.

Business software provider requires an agreement with Unifaun for using XMLPosting and each end user requires a license of Unifaun ERPConnect to benefit from integration.

**Implementation Points of ERP provider**

- Able to save user ID, password, and any profile in the business system for the users who will utilize Unifaun Online's services. See Sec. 3.
- Create an order file in XML format according to Chap. 5 of carriers, transport services and additional services that are current.
- Be able to post this order file to Unifaun Online under Sec. 6.
- Letting users log in Unifaun Online, via either [www.unifaun.com](www.unifaun.com) or directly via a URL under Sec 7.

**Features for users**

- The user creates order in the ERP system.
- Hard copies of shipping documents made in Unifaun Online.
- Monitoring is done in Unifaun Online.

## User management

All users of the ERP system designed to send shipments by Unifaun Online must be registered users of Unifaun Online.This means that they have an active user ID and password. A user ID normally consists of 10 to 16 characters (maximum 50 characters) and a password normally 4 to 6 characters (maximum 50 characters). Both of these are provided and administered by Unifaun and can not be changed by the user directly. As a registered user identity is tied to this one (or more) number at current carriers, which in turn will be charged the shipping services are announced through Unifaun Online.

Some clients with complex transport flows, in addition to user identity and password also have one or more profiles associated with the user identity which, when given at login. Profile name, with its associated password, determined in these cases by the customer and can be a maximum of 50 characters long. Profiles used in Unifaun Online to give different users different rights, and the separation order data, sender, recipient directory, broadcasting history, etc., and requires the customer signed an agreement Unifaun Online Plus.

The ERP system needs to store a user ID and password for those users who want to be able to mail order files to Unifaun Online.Where appropriate, one or more profile names and their passwords need to be stored in connection with the user's identity. In order files to be mailed to Unifaun Online business system must send the correct user ID and password. Shall direct links from the ERP system to Unifaun Online used also needed this user ID and password, and any profile.

It may be appropriate to logging events in the ERP system in order to detect any problems.

Security around and management of user identity, password and profile is of course important to ensure system integrity and prevent incorrect charges.

A Unifaun Online user ID must also have an agreement with Unifaun ERP Connect to receive the mailed order files. This agreement between the end user and Unifaun.

Business software provider needs to implement the following process to deploy new or existing customers in Unifaun Online:

1. Account in Unifaun Online. If customers are not yet a customer of Unifaun and therefore do not have a user identity in Unifaun Online, customers can arrange this via Unifaun support.

2. User ID, Password, and Profile. Allow customers to enter their Unifaun Online user identity, password, and any profile in the business system and store it appropriately in the ERP system so that they can be used by the ERP system when creating order files and to log in Unifaun Online.

3. Order Unifaun ERPConnect. Ask the customer to obtain a license by Unifaun ERPConnect tied to user identity in Unifaun Online. This can be done by contacting Unifaun Support. Please send a message to Unifaun that a customer will order Unifaun ERPConnect. Attach customer anv√§nderidentet if equipped. Then Unifaun announce ERP software provider in order coupling is activated and ready for operation.

4. Send Test files. For the first customers, or about new features or freight services to be used, it is important to send test files to Unifaun before the customer is in full operation. ERP Vendor own user identity in Unifaun Online can be used for testing. Contact Unifaun before the tests are done.

The ordinary process for connecting users of Unifaun ERPConnect includes testing and acceptance of order file. If XMLPosting used, make this step of the ERP vendor and need not be repeated in retail. Tests also are not required for each new customer, but only when the shrills new functionality.

Visit [www.unifaun.com](www.unifaun.com) for contact details and more information on orders.

Business software supplier is responsible for order files mailed to Unifaun Online is correct and contains information in accordance with the terms of current carriers freight services. Business software provider is also responsible for the connection between orders data and Unifaun Online User's identity is correct.

## 4 Using Unifaun Online Business System

Users of web-based business software needs Unifaun Online if they send pallets, parcels or certain types of letters. The interaction between the ERP system and Unifaun Online simplified by XMLPosting. The method allows the ERP system to send the necessary information to print shipping labels, EDI interchange and monitoring of shipments directly to Unifaun Online and so avoid doing the same work in two systems.

The following is a simplified description of the user process in the ERP, respectively.

### In the ERP system

- The user registers an order in the ERP system, indicates how and with which carrier the order must be shipped.

- Tasks such as recipient information, transport, any additional services, weight, number of packages, content and reference, must be attached to the order. Depending on the situation, the ERP system will automatically add certain tasks, such as content, weight and the reference without the user having to specify them. The ERP system must not provide the required data. The user can complete retrospective in Unifaun Online's user interface.

- After registration of the order creating the business system an order file under Unifaun specification. Sender can be included in its entirety in order file or placing in advance in Unifaun Online and only referenced in the order file.

- The ERP system mail order file to Unifaun Online.

- The user can log in Unifaun Online via either [www.unifaun.com](www.unifaun.com) or by link from the ERP system.

### In Unifaun Online

- Order from the ERP system are stored in Unifaun Online ready for printing.

- Any adjustments or additions can be made in Unifaun Online's user interface, for example if the information from the ERP system does not contain all the required data.

- The user prints the shipping documents from Unifaun Online's user interface and EDI sent to the carrier automatically (where the carrier can receive EDI).

- Monitoring of all shipments made in the last 6 months (possibly less number of transmissions is large) can be made from Unifaun Online's user interface, incl. package increases of carriers and services where increase package supported.

- Occasional shipments that are not registered by the ERP system can be registered directly in Unifaun Online's user interface, and then printed out along with orders from the ERP system or the side.

- Printers and labels designed for use with Unifaun Online, is available from Unifaun Online.

- More detailed help on using Unifaun Online is available in Unifaun Online's user interface.

### Create order file

Orderfilsformatet is XML-based and follows the usual conventions for XML files as specified by [www.w3.org/XML](www.w3.org/XML). This means that modern tools for creating XML files can and should be used to reduce the risk of errors.

One advantage of XML is that the format allows for the continuous development and additions to the functionality of Unifaun Online without requiring immediate action by the ERP vendor.

**The ERP system will need:**

- Provide interface where the end user can specify the full address details incl. phone number and email address for notification of the services require. Carrier's product descriptions and product terms (provided by the carrier) shows what is required for each service. The ERP system normally store this in the customer register. Since the information is completed in Unifaun Online after it has been posted from the ERP system, some information may be omitted.

- Provide interface where the end user can enter complete information for the shipment incl. number of packages, contents and importance of the services that require it.Carrier product descriptions show that this what is required for each service. The ERP system normally store this in the command register. This information may not be complete as it can be completed in Unifaun Online after it has been posted from the ERP system.

- Storing codes for freight services and facilities in order to create the correct order files.

- Storing descriptions of freight services and facilities in plain text to display for the end user.

- Be able to create an order file in XML format, as specified below.

A orderfils structure:

- An order file follows the XML standard, [www.w3.org](www.w3.org). Modern, stable tools should always be used to create and read XML files to avoid problems with character encoding and format / syntax.

- The first line of the file is XML header with information about character encoding. Most commonly used in Sweden is ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) and UTF-8. Always specify this information in the XML header and then use consistently throughout the file to the standard you set.

E.g.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
```

- This is followed by a head-XML block `<unifaunonline>` containing a number of XML-block of type meta `<meta>`, `<SENDER>` sender, receiver `<receiver>` and broadcast `<shipment>`. There must be a meta-block, zero, one or more avs√§ndarblock, zero, one or more receiver block and one or more of windows.

- Meta-book contains information about who created the order file and when the file was created. This is very important for troubleshooting and support.

- Senderblock contains information about the sender. `sndid` (Sender) in senderblock referenced from the transmission block "from" hold. Often the same senderblock for all the transmission blocks in the order file. If several senderblock's order file must sndid be unique for each block. Senderblock may also be delivered in the order file if it is prepared in Unifaun Online.

- The receiver includes information about the receiver. `rcvid` (reciver identity) referenced from the transmission block "to" hold. Most often creates a recipient by sending blocks. If multiple recipient blocks in an order file must `rcvid` be unique in the file. The receiver block can also be delivered in the order file if it is prepared in Unifaun Online through import of recipient register.

- Sending book represents a transmission from a sender to a receiver containing a delivery service, any additional services and information about the packages contained.

**Information for Support and Troubleshooting**

To Unifaun be able to help with any problems, it is essential that information about who created the order file and when it is created attached order file. This is done in the initial meta-block. Identity of the "original" tag should be User ID of the system that creates the order file and the User ID of the customer. See the following example.

### Examples of the order file

**Example Post**

- A shipment consisting of two parcels of books 2 and 3 kg. As identity used ERP system order number (928374 in this example).

- Shipping Service is Post Parcel Post, Code: P25.

- Additional services are COD, Code: COD of 450 USD to bank with an OCR as reference and SMS notification, Code: NOTSMS, to a mobile number.Cash on delivery means that the customer pays the amount in the extradition of the package and the Post put the money in the account with the specified reference. SMS notification means in connection with cash on delivery, to an SMS sent to the specified mobile number when the package arrived at the delivery point as well as a reminder of the package has been more than a certain number of days.

- The broadcast will also be pre-notified by e-mail, access code: enot. The eight message sent in connection with EDI sent to the Post.

- Sender has already organized in Unifaun Online (typical) with a quick search value 'AVS1' (for this example).

- Recipient information attached order file. As identity used ERP system ID number (81010 in this example).

## Post order file to Unifaun Online

When an order file is created, it shall be mailed to Unifaun Online for the user to print shipping labels.

The order file is sent via HTTPS to [https://www.unifaunonline.com/ufoweb/order](https://www.unifaunonline.com/ufoweb/order) via the POST method. Actual file is sent directly to the message. There is thus no packaging of the order file in a message of MIME type in the way a browser does the file upload.

On URL:n specify the following parameters:

- `session` parameter is set at the first call to "ufo_SE" and the subsequent call to the value that was returned
- `user` User ID for the user that the order to send in order
- `pin` Password for the user ID specified in the user
- `type` Format of order file. In this case always "xml"

```php

In response to the HTTPS call got an XML file in the following format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<response>
  <val n="session"> ufo_SE_E9821F8B1134330EE4A2760588B_0 </option>
  <val n="status"> 201 </option>
  <val n="message"> Created </option>
</response>
```

This is an example of a successful transmission. If something goes wrong in the scanning or login so got a different status and a different message in the "message". Possible status codes:

- `403` (logon failure). Verify user identity, password, and the account to Unifaun Online is active and that the order coupling function is active.

- `500` (reading problems). Check order file which contains syntax errors.

The value "session" can be used as a value of the parameter session on subsequent uploads of orders for the same user identity. Note, however, that the session is tied to a particular login so if an order for another user identity shall be sent, the parameter session set back to "ufo_SE" again.

A package-id is not generated by Unifaun Online before shipping labels are printed. Therefore, these can not return report discounted to the ERP system. Kolli Identities are generally used to perform tracking of goods, but one can instead be done with the business system order number or reference. See Section 8 below.

**Please note:** This way of posting order files to Unifaun Online may change in the future to enable new functionality. Unifaun will notify such changes as early as possible before the changes take effect. You may need to modify the way to post files to Unifaun Online.
